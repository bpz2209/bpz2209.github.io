<!-- Dark Souls III Info -->
Dark Souls III is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The fourth installment in the Souls series and the final installment of the Dark Souls trilogy, the game was released in Japan in March 2016 and worldwide a month later. Dark Souls III was critically and commercially successful, with critics calling it a worthy and fitting conclusion to the series. It was the fastest-selling game in Bandai Namco's history, shipping over three million copies worldwide within the first two months after release. Like the previous games in the series, Dark Souls III is known for its challenging difficulty, its rewarding sense of accomplishment, and its exploration of themes of despair and the apocalypse.
